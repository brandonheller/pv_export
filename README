pv_export: a simple tool to create PDFs from Protovis source
Brandon Heller

Derives from code by Jamie Love, posted to Protovis mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/protovis/browse_thread/thread/ee5737796b4235eb/2e2af35c583504fd

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN:
Ensure you have the SUN JDK 1.6 or later (OpenJDK won't work).  Then run:

> ./pv_export.sh

This should generate output/test_out.pdf w/a sample line chart.

Modify params in pv_export.sh to customize; see the examples in the examples/
directory.

NOTES:
Protovis produces beautiful vector output, but it's normally confined to the
browser.  Yeah, you could manually use print-to-PDF from a web browser, or
you could script a particular web browser to do PDF output given an HTML
file, and you'd get PDF output.  I want a method for generating PDFs that is:
- non-browser-dependent
- non-OS-dependent
- easy to install (doesn't require compilation)
- easy to automate

pv_export tries to achieve these properties, by combining a bunch of open-
source libraries and providing an easier interface on top of them.  Includes:
- Rhino: JavaScript interpreter
- envJS: a browser environment in JavaScript
- Batik: library for vector graphics
